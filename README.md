# APIs and Making Humankind Better at Programming
## Carter Rabasa - JSConf 2013

All of the code for my slides are located in the `gh-pages` branch. You can view the slides themselves on [http://crabasa.github.io/jsconf-2013/][1].

The Node.js code that I used to send people an SMS is right here in the `master` branch in `thanks.js`.
